# Trapped-Geodesics-In-Polytropic-Stars
This repository is for the paper "Trapped Geodesics in Charged Polytropic Fluid Spheres with a Cosmological Constant" written by Alex Stornelli, Anish Agashe, Shalini Ganguly, and James Ripple.

All plots shown in the paper can be found in the Plot Code folder and the videos used to make the plots can be found in the Animation folder.

The plot image names correspond as follows, LHS is the LHS vs \chi plots and SC is scatter plots.
